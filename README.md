👋 Hi, I’m Sana FaTiMa

👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I’m passionate about building impactful solutions and exploring new ideas in AI technology.

🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into advanced Deep Learning techniques through the CS231n course from Stanford, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers like BERT and YOLO. Additionally, I’m enhancing my skills in cloud deployment and productionizing machine learning models for real-world applications.

💻 I have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, which helps me tackle complex problems efficiently. I also actively participate in Kaggle competitions, where I apply my skills to real-world data challenges and continuously improve my machine learning expertise.

✍️ I write articles on my Medium account, sharing insights from my journey in AI and ML, with a focus on making complex topics easy to understand. Check out my work here:https://medium.com/@sanitta

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source AI/ML projects, particularly those focused on real-time object detection, image processing, and natural language processing (NLP).
